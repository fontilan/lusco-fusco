lusco-fusco (Portuguese for "twilight") is the name of my monthly-updated Spotify playlist. 
I love discovering new music, so this monthly commitment keeps me motivated to stay up to date with new releases.
The playlist somehow gained a few anonymous followers, so I have to keep going, I can't let them down! :smile:
